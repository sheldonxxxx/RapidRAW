# RapidRAW MCP documentation

The live tool inventory is `rapidraw_capabilities`, not any static matrix. For installation and connection, start with the [agent setup guide](../../AGENT_SETUP.md); for the npm package runtime contract, see [mcp/README.md](../../mcp/README.md).

## Mask composition

This checkout adds `mask_duplicate` to copy a parent selection into an independent mask with fresh IDs. By default it clears the copied mask's local adjustments; `invert: true` toggles the copied parent's selection. With `invert: true, link: true` the copy stays the inverse of its source: later changes to the source selection are copied into it on every MCP edit, while its own adjustments are kept. `mask_generate` accepts `target_mask_id` and `mode` to add a generated AI component to an existing parent. These calls support a subject mask paired with its inverse and a generated depth band intersected with another selection. Native acceptance exercised the built-in depth path; Marigold uses the same composition path after remote inference, but that provider was not exercised in this check. `mask_update` continues to add supplied brush and color components. Inspect the rendered parent after every composition change.

Use `rapidraw_capabilities` to confirm that the connected native bridge advertises these methods. The independently versioned npm host and packaged native app must both contain the matching changes; the pinned `0.2.0` host in the current setup guide predates these operations.

The [method parity test](../../mcp/test/method-parity.test.mjs) checks that every native bridge method has a Node MCP tool; the Node host also has five job-management tools. This establishes API exposure, not photographic quality or proof that every parameter combination has been exercised. Use the [testing guide](testing.md) for native and rendered-output checks. Desktop catalog navigation, tethering, and interface preferences are outside this photo-editing inventory.

Dated September 2026 snapshots. They preserve the measurements and claims recorded at the time; they are not the live tool inventory or current support matrix.
