# RapidRAW + MCP

An independent companion to **[Lightweft](https://github.com/sheldonxxxx/lightweft)**, the main project for AI photo-editing direction, personal style and visual review.

**Give your AI agent a native, reversible photo editor.**

This independent fork of [RapidRAW](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW) adds an optional Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface to its GPU-accelerated RAW editor. An agent can inspect a photograph, adjust light and colour, refine masks, compare rendered alternatives, and export a finished image while preserving the original and its existing sidecar.

Use RapidRAW on its own, connect it to your preferred MCP client, or pair it with [Lightweft](https://github.com/sheldonxxxx/lightweft), the central workspace for photographic direction, rendered review and personal style exploration. Lightweft and the [Insta360 AI Toolkit](https://github.com/sheldonxxxx/insta360-ai-toolkit) are separate, optional projects.

> A beautiful, non-destructive, and GPU-accelerated RAW image editor built with performance in mind.

RapidRAW is a modern, high-performance alternative to Adobe Lightroom®. This fork ships standard packages for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs and Linux x86_64; each includes the native MCP bridge.

**[AI editing test report](docs/ai-editing-experiments.md):** what we tested on a 16 GB GPU and how we chose the current workflows.

**Removal coverage and protection:** desktop and MCP removal controls separate core expansion from the outer blend. Preview the effective mask before running local inpaint or generative editing, and use subtractive components to protect retained details. The same native mask is used for generation and final compositing. See the [removal workflow](skills/rapidraw-mcp/references/generative-editing.md#native-removal-coverage-and-protection).

**[ComfyUI integration guide](docs/comfyui.md):** one connector for generative editing and optional depth, tested ComfyUI revisions, GPU memory guidance and [downloadable chosen workflows](ai-connector/workflows/README.md).

For repeated MCP editing and test runs, see [storage and model-cache guidance](mcp/README.md#runtime-contract).

**Shape light, colour and depth:** [three optional editing tools](docs/creative-selections.md) help you shape directional light, select surface colours across light and shadow, and adjust nearer or more distant parts of a photo. Pick colours on the photograph, choose a light direction or a depth starting range, then refine the edit with local controls. Saved analysis works offline in native previews and exports. These source-build tools use Marigold through the [shared AI connector](ai-connector/MARIGOLD.md) and are disabled by default.

**Local Edits:** manage masked repairs and adjustments together, refine each selection, and copy supported selections between edit types while keeping the edits independent. Shape Light and Surface Colour selections are adjustment-only. Generative repairs use the active crop and return to the original photo geometry.

## Choose your starting point

| You want to…                                                      | Start here                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Edit photographs directly in a desktop application                | [Desktop guide](docs/desktop-guide.md) and [fork application downloads](https://github.com/sheldonxxxx/RapidRAW/releases/latest)                                                             |
| Let an AI agent use RapidRAW's native engine                      | Install a fork release package and connect the pinned npm host with the [agent setup guide](AGENT_SETUP.md) (package-first normal path; source build is the fallback)                        |
| Give your agent an editing workflow and a place to review results | Start with [Lightweft](https://github.com/sheldonxxxx/lightweft), then add RapidRAW as an optional execution tool                                                                            |
| Prepare saved Insta360 files before editing                       | Use the independent [Insta360 AI Toolkit](https://github.com/sheldonxxxx/insta360-ai-toolkit), then follow the [spherical handoff guide](skills/rapidraw-mcp/references/spherical-photos.md) |

**Fork packages include the native MCP bridge.** Choose a matching asset from the [fork releases](https://github.com/sheldonxxxx/RapidRAW/releases), then connect the pinned npm host [`@sheldonxxxx/rapidraw-mcp@0.2.0`](AGENT_SETUP.md) without cloning this repository. Upstream application downloads do not contain this fork's bridge. Fresh-machine acceptance of packaged MCP downloads has not been established; the source-build workflows retain their recorded test boundaries. The server uses your MCP client's model; it does not include a language model or a hosted editing service.

Apple Silicon builds require macOS 14 or later and bundle ONNX Runtime 1.30.0 for local AI inference. Intel Mac builds retain the existing runtime. See the [runtime and hardware guide](docs/local-enhancement.md#apple-silicon-runtime).

**Apple Silicon Beta 1 installation:** the published package has an incomplete bundle signature and can be reported as damaged. See the [installation troubleshooting guide](docs/desktop-guide.md#macos-beta-1-signature-error).

**First beta:** `fork-v0.1.0-beta.1`, installed as **RapidRAW MCP** with separate application preferences and model storage. See the [release notes](docs/releases/0.1.0-beta.1.md) for installation and beta limits.

## What an agent can do

- **Develop the photograph:** exposure, white balance, colour, curves, crop, perspective, lens corrections, presets and LUTs through the native RAW pipeline.
- **Work selectively:** AI subject, sky, foreground and depth selections; point-guided refinement; additive and subtractive brush repairs; geometric and range masks.
- **Review actual pixels:** original and edited previews, matched alternatives, mask overlays, native detail crops, histograms and regional measurements.
- **Keep edits recoverable:** revision guards, undo/redo, named versions, independent session forks, portable bundles, recipes and saved native sidecars.
- **Finish and deliver:** local retouch, BM3D/AI denoise, background operations, batch exports, explicit sRGB profile handling and high-precision 16-bit TIFF output.

The desktop AI panel and MCP also offer [local mask and detail enhancement](docs/local-enhancement.md): learned edge refinement, scene and portrait-part masks, experimental motion deblur and conservative 2× enlargement. Optional model assets run locally, with profiles for smaller computers and Linux NVIDIA servers.

The desktop **Inpaint studio** offers 1–4 variations, automatically applies the final result when a full batch finishes, and keeps click-to-apply history for each edit. It accepts up to four reference images with supporting Qwen Image 2.1 and Klein edit workflows. Compatible AI Connectors also expose workflow, AI resolution and seed choices in Local Edits and generative MCP retouch. Actual generation dimensions stay with the patch when the provider supplies them. Set up the included [Comfy Connector](ai-connector/README.md) and see the [generative editing controls](docs/desktop-guide.md#generative-editing-controls) for resolution and compatibility details. These controls require a current build of this fork.

The optional AI Connector automatically [matches small repair colour differences at selection boundaries](ai-connector/README.md#automatic-repair-colour-matching) and also supports the **Qwen Image 2.1** removal workflow; see its [model and node requirements](ai-connector/README.md#qwen-image-21).

For removal, recolouring, adding objects and lettering, follow the [AI editing workflows](docs/ai-editing-workflows.md). Start with Klein 4B at 1 MP and compare the rendered result before changing models or resolution.

The server exposes **65 MCP tools** over stdio. Local AI operations need their model assets installed. HDR, focus merging, panorama and negative conversion are also exposed, with photographic acceptance limits documented in the [historical capability snapshot](docs/mcp/history/capability-matrix-2026-09.md). The live `rapidraw_capabilities` response defines the available tools and schemas for your build.

## Connect an agent

1. Install a fork release package and connect the pinned npm host using the [agent setup guide](AGENT_SETUP.md). Source builds via the [source-build fallback](mcp/README.md#build-and-connect) or the [Linux GPU server guide](docs/mcp/remote-ssh.md) remain the fallback for development or unsupported platforms.
2. Optionally install the execution skill:

   ```sh
   npx skills add sheldonxxxx/RapidRAW --skill rapidraw-mcp
   ```

3. Reconnect your MCP client and call `rapidraw_capabilities`. Installing the skill alone does not connect the engine.
4. Start with one photograph and a clear brief. Review the original, an edited overview and native detail before exporting.

For example:

> Edit this landscape for natural evening light. Preserve the original and its sidecar, show me a restrained edit beside a warmer alternative, and export the chosen result with an editable session.

The [execution skill](skills/rapidraw-mcp/SKILL.md) covers state, masks, comparisons and delivery. It works with a direct brief or your preferred art-direction skill; Lightweft supplies an optional shared workflow around it.

## Three independent projects, one connected workflow

| Project                                                                   | Responsibility                                                               | Handoff                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Lightweft](https://github.com/sheldonxxxx/lightweft)                     | Central workspace for direction, review and personal style                   | An image-specific brief and rendered candidates for comparison |
| **RapidRAW + MCP**                                                        | Native photographic editing, persistent state and exports                    | Previews, editable sessions, recipes and delivery files        |
| [Insta360 AI Toolkit](https://github.com/sheldonxxxx/insta360-ai-toolkit) | Postprocessing saved Insta360 media and preparing verified photo derivatives | A stitched sphere or selected flat reframe for editing         |

Each project has its own installation, dependencies and repository. RapidRAW does not require either companion. When combined, the agent coordinates their file handoffs; installing one project does not automatically install or configure the others.

RapidRAW edits the pixels it receives. Camera-native fisheye stitching and spherical reframing belong to the preparation tool. Review a full sphere's seams and poles and verify its final projection metadata after editing; the [handoff guide](skills/rapidraw-mcp/references/spherical-photos.md) explains the boundary.

## Tested configurations and current limits

| Configuration                                                 | Evidence and setup                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| macOS with Metal, native debug build                          | Native editing, state, rendering and export acceptance in the [historical verification snapshot](docs/mcp/history/verification-2026-09.md); [setup](mcp/README.md#build-and-connect) |
| Debian 13 x86-64, NVIDIA GPU, SSH and Xvfb                    | Exercised server workflow documented in the [Linux guide](docs/mcp/remote-ssh.md); this is a specific tested configuration                                                           |
| Optional Linux ONNX CUDA inference                            | Foreground/sky masks, depth and AI denoise via the pinned x86_64 runtime pack; [model policy and runtime setup](docs/mcp/onnx-cuda.md)                                               |
| Windows, packaged MCP releases and fresh-machine installation | No completed native acceptance claim                                                                                                                                                 |

Without the pinned NVIDIA runtime pack, existing mask and denoise operations default to CPU on every platform; with the pack installed, an unset provider defaults to CUDA (an explicit `cpu` is always preserved). Their Linux CUDA support is opt-in and separate from GPU photo rendering; subject selection and local inpainting retain CPU compatibility paths.

For GPU RAW denoising on an NVIDIA server, the optional [Nonlocal backend](denoise/README.md) integrates with MCP background jobs. It produces a Bayer DNG that uses RapidRAW's normal demosaic and colour pipeline, with captured edits in a separate session. The existing lightweight NIND option remains available. Nonlocal runs in-process through native ONNX Runtime from a pinned installed bundle (`RAPIDRAW_NONLOCAL_PROVIDER`: unset defaults to Linux CUDA and macOS CoreML, `cpu` is explicit), or directly through CoreML.framework on macOS (`RAPIDRAW_NONLOCAL_PROVIDER=coreml`); install it once with `install_model kind="nonlocal"` (`RAPIDRAW_NONLOCAL_BUNDLE` remains an explicit manual-bundle override); it is experimental, and commercial parity has not been established.

Passing an operation or test does not establish the quality of a photograph. Fine hair/feather masks, wide panorama framing, genuine HDR/focus brackets and film-negative quality have remaining acceptance gaps. See the [historical verification snapshot](docs/mcp/history/verification-2026-09.md), [historical capability snapshot](docs/mcp/history/capability-matrix-2026-09.md) and [historical gap assessment](docs/mcp/history/gap-assessment-2026-09.md) for precise boundaries; the live `rapidraw_capabilities` response defines the available tools and schemas for your build. Upstream platform availability is separate from this fork's MCP testing.

## Originals, privacy and local state

MCP editing uses isolated working copies in a workspace you choose. Original images and existing sidecars remain read-only to the workflow. Working files, model assets and saved exports are stored on the machine running the engine. With SSH, that is the server's filesystem.

Your MCP host receives requested previews and structured results, so choose its model and data handling accordingly. Model installation downloads local assets. Remote generative retouch is a separate, explicitly selected provider operation that sends image content and requires authorization and configuration.

Exports go under the MCP workspace's `exports` directory; replacing an existing export requires an explicit overwrite option. GPS stripping defaults on. These MCP protections are described in the [preservation contract](mcp/README.md#preservation-and-error-behavior); the desktop application and original export CLI have their own file-management behaviour.

### Supported Cameras

Tethering is powered by **[libgphoto2](http://gphoto.org/)** and supports over **2,500+ camera models** across Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, Olympus, Panasonic, and other manufacturers.

- **[View the Full List of Supported Cameras](http://gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php)**

> **Note:** Ensure your camera's USB connection mode is set to **PC Remote**, **Tether Shooting**, or **PTP** in the camera settings.

### Platform Support & Installation

Tethering is supported on **macOS** and **Linux**. Windows and Android are not supported.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why Does Tethering Require a Separate Build?</strong></summary>

The tethering build dynamically links directly against `libgphoto2`. If these system libraries are not present on a machine, an executable linked against them will fail to launch entirely. This fork does not publish a tethering-enabled package; build from source with the `tethering` feature after installing the system dependencies below.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is Windows Unsupported?</strong></summary>

`libgphoto2` is designed for POSIX environments and requires direct low-level access via `libusb`. On Windows, connected cameras are claimed by the operating system's native Windows Portable Device (WPD) drivers. Interfacing with `libgphoto2` on Windows requires overriding OEM drivers with WinUSB (using tools like Zadig), which breaks standard file transfer and camera utilities. Because of these driver conflicts and platform limitations, Windows is fully unsupported.

</details>

#### Setting up the Tethering Build

For a tethering-enabled source build, you **must install `libgphoto2` on your machine first**.

<details>
<summary><strong>How to install libgphoto2 dependencies</strong></summary>

**macOS (via Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install libgphoto2 pkg-config
```

**Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgphoto2-dev pkg-config
```

**Linux (Arch Linux):**

```bash
sudo pacman -S libgphoto2 pkgconf
```

**Linux (Fedora):**

```bash
sudo dnf install libgphoto2-devel pkgconf-pkg-config
```

</details>

After installing the system dependencies, run/build from source using the `tethering` feature flag.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

RapidRAW includes a headless export tool for batch processing photos in automated scripts, terminal pipelines, or server environments without opening the GUI:

```bash
# Export an entire folder using edits found in .rrdata sidecar files
rapidraw export /path/to/photos --output /path/to/output_dir --format jpeg --quality 90

# Export a single image directly to a specific target file
rapidraw export /path/to/photo.raw --output /path/to/output.png --format png

# Export a true 16-bit TIFF (the TIFF default; use 8 for an RGB8 TIFF)
rapidraw export /path/to/photo.raw --output /path/to/output.tiff --format tiff --tiff-bit-depth 16

# Batch export a folder using a custom adjustments JSON file to override sidecars
rapidraw export /path/to/photos --output /path/to/output_dir --adjustments /path/to/preset.json
```

> **Note:** By default, headless export automatically detects and applies edits stored in `.rrdata` sidecar files located alongside your source images. You can override sidecars for all exported images by passing a custom JSON file using the `--adjustments` flag.

- **Intel Mac:** macOS 13 (Ventura) or newer
- **Linux x86_64:** Ubuntu 22.04 or a compatible modern distribution

These requirements describe the fork's release packages. Source-build targets are a separate path; Windows packaged support and fresh-machine installation have not been verified for this fork.

**Hardware Recommendations:**

- **RAM:** **16GB or more is highly recommended.** While the application may run on systems with less memory, performance is best with 16GB+ to handle high-resolution RAW files, undo history, and complex layer masking without slowdowns.
- **GPU:** A dedicated GPU is recommended. RapidRAW relies heavily on GPU acceleration for its processing pipeline. Very old GPU architectures (generally pre-2015) or older integrated graphics may struggle, leading to instability or graphical artifacts.

### Common Problems

<details>
<summary>App crashes when opening an image / entering edit mode</summary>

If the application crashes immediately when you try to start editing a picture, it is often due to the automatic selection of the GPU backend.

1.  Open **Settings** on the **Home Screen** (Gear icon).
2.  Navigate to the **Processing** tab.
3.  Locate the **Processing Backend** setting.
4.  Change it from **Auto** to a specific backend supported by your OS (e.g., **Vulkan**, **DirectX12**, **OpenGL**, or **Metal**).
5.  Restart the application and try opening the image again. Experiment with different backends if the first one doesn't work.

<details>
<summary>Linux Wayland/WebKit Crash</summary>

If RapidRAW crashes on Wayland (e.g. GNOME + NVIDIA), try launching it with:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 RapidRAW
```

or

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 RapidRAW
```

This issue is related to **WebKit** and **NVIDIA drivers**, not RapidRAW directly. Switching to **X11** or using **AMD / Intel GPUs** may also help.

See [#306](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/issues/306) for more information.

### Image format issues

If your camera’s RAW files aren’t supported, please open a issue here first: [rawler issues](https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab/issues). Once support is added in rawler, create a issue for RapidRAW so I can update the packages and keep everything in sync.
